      <description>Title screen.
   Summary Ramsey and I were invited to participate in the Google AR Core Game Jam that took place in September of 2019 in Los Angeles. We made a multiplayer AR tennis type game where the room becomes a ball court. First the player must scan the room, and then enter each players names. Then the game begins! Each player&amp;rsquo;s name is called, and must take turns hitting the virtual ball.</description>

   Summary In the world of cut throat bunny street racing, where do you stand?
Bunny Blur is a work-in-progress stand alone car racing arcade game. I am experimenting with storytelling through the custom dashboard and the arcade cabinet itself. The game is influenced heavily by personal experience playing 80&amp;rsquo;s racing arcade games, goofy retro cartoons, and the Fast and Furious franchise. The intent here is to make a fun and engaging racing game that plays with the line between physical and digital experiences.</description>
