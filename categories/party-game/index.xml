   Summary Casual Encounters the Game is the brainchild of the brilliant Jeff Crouse. It is a party game where two people compete to match correctly the image with the Craigslist casual encounter ad title. The image is slowly revealed, rewarding the ability to imagine the rest of the image as quickly as possible.
A bunch of us teamed up with him at the Creator&amp;rsquo;s Project Art Hack Weekend that took place at Eyebeam in April 2011.</description>
